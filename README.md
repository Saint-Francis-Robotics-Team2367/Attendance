# Lancer Robotics Attendance

This is the attendance tracking program for Lancer Robotics (FRC Team 2367)

# Why does this exist?
In order to ensure that members of the team actively do work on the team, an attendance program is necessary to keep track of when team members enter and leave the robotics lab. This also makes it easy for students to see whether they are maintaining hours to officially be in the robotics club for the sake of club credit. 

# How does the attendance system work?
The attendance system uses a barcode scanner or standard keyboard input to enter a student ID number. Then, while a student is signed in, they gain hours. When the student checks out when they leave the lab by either scaning their ID card or entering their ID number, the program stops counting hours for that student.
